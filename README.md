# 🏆 Final Capstone Project – Machine Learning Prototype  

> Final project simulating a real-world data science job: built and delivered an ML prototype with work plan, code, and final report.

✅ Español: Proyecto final de integración simulando un entorno real de trabajo en ciencia de datos: desarrollo de un prototipo de machine learning con plan de trabajo, código y reporte final.  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This is the **final sprint (Sprint 18)** of the Data Science Bootcamp at TripleTen Latam.  
The goal was to simulate a **real-world data science role**, where the student takes part in a team structure (team lead, senior colleague, project reviewer) and is responsible for delivering a **complete ML project from planning to reporting**.  



---

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed  
- Drafted a **Work Plan** based on incomplete/inconsistent task definition.  
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to clarify requirements.  
- Developed and tested **ML models** to solve the assigned problem.  
- Prepared a **Final Report** with methodology, results, and recommendations.  
- Delivered code, documentation, and insights for review.

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- `work_plan.md` → Project work plan and task breakdown.  
- `solution_notebook.ipynb` → Full Jupyter Notebook with data prep, EDA, model building, and evaluation.  
- `final_report.md` → Executive-style report summarizing methodology, results, and next steps.

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📈 Results  
- Successfully delivered a **machine learning prototype** aligned with the requirements.  
- Showcased ability to **analyze vague problem definitions**, structure tasks, and deliver results in a **team-like environment**.  
- Reinforced skills in both **technical ML modeling** and **business-oriented communication**.
